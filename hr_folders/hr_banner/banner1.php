				The Atlas Room is a reservation driven restaurant. We do welcome walk ins and will accommodate them whenever possible. We do have a lounge area where we serve the full menu and we do not accept reservations for this area with the exception of immediate neighbors. This policy is meant to ensure guest enjoyment of their experience with us. 
				Our dining room seats 28 people at 7 tables at any one time with additional 8 seats at two high top lounge tables, 6 seats at the bar and additional 6 seats along the lounge edge .
